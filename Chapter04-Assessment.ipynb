    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will introduce tree based methods. First, we will learn about the basic decision tree, then we will see how decision trees performance can be improved via ensemble methods - specifically, gradient descent boosting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1. Aims of the Exercise:\n",
    " 1. To introduce the single Decision Tree, as well as the Gradient Boosted Trees.\n",
    " 2. To explore parameters and determine appropriate choices.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "It aligns with all the learning outcome of our course: \n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tDistinguish a range of task specific machine learning techniques appropriate for Health Data Science.\n",
    "2.\tDesign machine learning tasks for Health Data Science scenarios.\n",
    "3.\tConstruct appropriate training and test sets for health research data.\n",

    "## 1.2. Jupyter Notebook Intructions\n",
    "1. Read the content of each cell.\n",
    "2. Where necessary, follow the instructions that are written in each cell.\n",
    "3. Run/Execute all the cells that contain Python code sequentially (one at a time), using the \"Run\" button.\n",
    "4. For those cells in which you are asked to write some code, please write the Python code first and then execute/run the cell.\n",
    " \n",
    "## 1.3. Tips\n",
    " 1. The square brackets on the left hand side of each cell indicate whether the cell has been executed or not. Empty square brackets mean that the cell has not been executed, whereas square brackets that contain a number means that the cell has been executed. Run all the cells in sequence, using the \"Run\" button.\n",
    " 2. To edit this notebook, just double-click in each cell. In the document, each cell can be a \"Code\" cell or \"text-Markdown\" cell. To choose between these two options, go to the combo-box above. \n",
    " 3. If you want to save your notebook, please make sure you press \"the floppy disk\" icon button above. \n",
    " 4. To clean the content of all cells and re-start Notebook, please go to Cell->All Output->Clear\n"

    "* n_estimators: Unlike Gradient Boosted Decision Trees, Random Forests *always* improve with an increased number of estimators, and there is no danger of overfitting. However, there are diminishing returns, with improvement quickly plateauing. The number of estimators is limited by our time and computational resources. <p>\n",
    "* max_features: This is the number of features to consider when looking for the best split. max_features determines how random each tree is. A large max_features means the trees will be more similar, possibly allowing for overfitting. On the other hand, a smaller max_features reduces overfitting, but may force each tree to be very deep. For classification, it is common to use the default of max_features = $\\sqrt {number\\:of\\:features}$.<p>\n",
