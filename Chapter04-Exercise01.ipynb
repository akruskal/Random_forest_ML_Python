The method can be used for both regression (predicting numeric response variable) and classification (classifying a categorical response variable). As the set of splitting rules used to segment the feature space can be summarized into a hierarchy of if/else statements in the form of a tree, these types of approaches are known as decision tree methods.<p>\n",
    "    In the case of **regression**, in order to make a prediction for any particular observation, we usually use the mean of the training observations in the region to which it belongs. For **classification**, we usually use the mode of the training observations in the region to which the data point belongs. Recall that the mode is the most frequent element. So, *for classification we predict that each observation belongs to the most commonly occurring class of training observations in the region to which it belongs*.<p>\n",

The split is achieved by using a *test*. The form of the test depends on the data type of the chosen feature.\n",
    "* If the feature of choice is continuous, the test will be of the form $X_i > a$, where $a$ is some constant. In other words, the tests that are used on continuous data are of the form 'is feature i larger than the value a?'. \n",

    "\n",
    "Ideally, we would like to tune the three most important parameters: n_estimator, max_depth, and learning_rate. However, as we are restrained by both time and computational power, we will restrict ourselves to tuning only the learning_rate. For max_depth, it is standard practice to limit the ensemble to quite shallow trees, so we we will choose max_depth = 3. The parameters n_estimator and learning_rate are highly interconnected, as a lower learning_rate means that more trees are needed to build a model of similar complexity. Using this knowledge, we will choose a value of n_estimators that is feasible given our time and computational power constraints, and then find the best learning_rate given this value of n_estimators.\n",
